                        <p>
                            Chicken stew is one of those dinners that makes a cold winter night feel a little better. The hearty, cozy flavors are pure comfort food.
                            It typically takes a long time to make stew, but not so when you have an Instant Pot pressure cooker. Once it comes to pressure, this Instant Pot chicken stew takes just 10 minutes to cook. It feels like a miracle to be able to make stew so quickly on a busy night.
                            If you don’t have a pressure cooker, you can simmer this stew on the stove or in the oven until the chicken is cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

                            This Instant Pot chicken stew takes about 45 minutes from beginning to end, including prep time and the time it takes the pot to come to pressure. 
                            For thick chicken breasts of about an inch thickness, the cook time for this recipe is 10 minutes at manual high pressure. If your chicken breasts are thinner, you can change the cook time accordingly. A thickness of ½ inch should be done cooking after a 5 minute cook time. Use a meat thermometer to confirm that the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165 degrees.
                            The vegetables are quite tender in this Instant Pot chicken stew. I like how the potatoes break down a bit and help to thicken the stew. If you’d prefer the vegetables to be firmer, use thin chicken breast and reduce the high pressure cook time to 5 minutes. 
                            I like to chop the vegetables into larger bite-sized pieces so they don’t turn too mushy. The green beans are cut into 1 inch pieces, and the carrot and potato pieces are about ¾ inch thick.
                            The gravy is quite thick in this Instant Pot chicken stew. Cut back on the amount of arrowroot starch (or skip it altogether) for a soupier consistency.
