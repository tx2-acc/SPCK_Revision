                        <p>
                            Waffles are always a fun treat for breakfast. Topped with berry sauce, pure maple syrup, or a little jam, this traditional breakfast is a great way to start the weekend.
                            My family loves the flavor and texture of these oat flour waffles. Similar to my oat flour pancakes, the base of these fluffy waffles is ground oats. These are a wonderful, healthier alternative to traditional waffles.
                            Despite being whole grain, these oat flour waffles have a light texture. They’re so delicious and filling. I like to serve them with fresh berries for a nutritious start to the day.

                            This recipe is simple to make, but there are a few tips that will help. It’s best to have all the ingredients at room temperature so the coconut oil doesn’t solidify when it meets up with cold milk and eggs. Other mild oils such as avocado oil will also work, or you could use melted butter or ghee instead of coconut oil if you’re not avoiding dairy.
                            If possible, it helps to let the batter sit for 30 minutes before making these gluten-free waffles. This allows the batter to thicken up a bit. It’s not entirely necessary, though, so you can skip this step if you’re in a hurry. The oat flour waffles may be a bit more delicate when you’re removing them from the waffle iron if you don’t let the batter sit for 30 minutes.
                            When pouring the batter into the waffle iron, spread it out a bit with a spatula to ensure even cooking. This will help keep excess batter from dripping off the sides.
                            If you have leftover batter, you can cook all the waffles and refrigerate them for another time. To reheat the waffles, I like to microwave them for 30 seconds, then place them in the toaster oven for a couple minutes to crisp them up. You could also reheat them right in the waffle maker.

                        <p>
                            You can use store-bought oat flour or make your own. I put 6 ounces of traditional rolled oats in my blender and process for 20 to 30 seconds, until I have a fine flour. A cup of oats yields about a cup of oat flour. You could also use a food processor.
                            If you need your oat flour to be strictly gluten-free, be sure to use certified gluten-free oats. Oats themselves are naturally gluten-free, but there can be cross-contamination with wheat during the grain transportation process.
