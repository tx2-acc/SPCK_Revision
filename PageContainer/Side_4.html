                        <span>About Gluten Free Oat Bread & Tips</span> 
                        <p>This gluten free oat bread is so hearty and flavorful! It’s simple to make this dairy free bread using traditional oats, and the whole loaf costs less than $3 to make.</p>
                        <p>
                            Gluten free bread can get expensive. The store-bought versions tend to be small and pricey, and even the homemade versions often require several different types of specialty flour.
                            This gluten free oat bread is another story. It costs just $2.73 to make, and it tastes delicious. The only flour you’ll need to make this bread is ground oats. My family prefers the taste and texture of this bread over the other gluten free loaves we’ve tried.

                            This oat bread can be used to make a sandwich or a piece of toast slathered with jam. I like to eat it on its own as a snack bread. It’s not overly sweet like a typical loaf of dessert bread or muffins, but it’s sweet enough to feel like a snack.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I make my own oat flour by blending traditional rolled oats in a high powered blender for about 30 seconds. After grinding the oats into a flour, you can add the other dry ingredients and mix them together right in the blender.
                            For a shortcut, you can use packaged oat flour instead. Substitute 4 cups of the oat flour for the rolled oats in this recipe.
                            This bread is a bit delicate, so make sure to let it cool before slicing. If you’d prefer a more typical sandwich-type gluten free bread, substitute 2 cups of your favorite gluten free flour blend for 2 cups of the oat flour. If you make this substitution, you can omit the xanthan gum from the recipe.
