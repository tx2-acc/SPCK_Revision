                        <span>About Mediterranean Rice & Tips</span> 
                        <p>Flavored rice packets were one of the first things to go when my family switched to eating a less processed diet several years ago. I definitely missed the convenience of those packets, but I didn’t miss all the additives in the ingredient lists.</p>
                        <p>
                            Luckily, it’s very easy to make flavored rice from scratch. In less than 30 minutes, I can have a rice side dish ready to go.</p>
                        <p>
                            This Mediterranean rice is a light, mildly flavored rice dish that will go with just about anything. I like to serve it with meat or fish and a simple vegetable side dish.</p>
                        <p>
                            I like jasmine rice in this recipe, but any type of rice will do here. Be sure to adjust the cooking time according to the instructions on the rice package.

                            This recipe can be made in a pot on the stove, or it can be cooked in a pressure cooker like the Instant Pot. I personally prefer the texture of rice cooked in the Instant Pot, and it’s more difficult to mess it up when cooking in a pressure cooker. The stove top method yields a stickier, more moist rice, so use that method if that’s your preference.
                            
                            If you make the stove top version, be sure to simmer the rice over low heat. If you simmer at a higher temperature, the liquid will be absorbed too quickly and the rice will stick to the bottom of the pot before it becomes tender. Stir the rice every couple minutes while it cooks, and add extra water a quarter cup at a time in the last few minutes if the rice is still hard.

                            In the Instant Pot, this rice comes out perfectly for me with a cook time of 6 minutes at high pressure. Depending on your altitude, the hardness of your water, and the freshness of your rice, the cook time can vary. Some people find a 4 or 5 minute cook time to be ideal for jasmine rice. You may need to experiment with different times.

                            For the best lemon flavor, use a microplane to get the bits of lemon zest nice and small. This helps to distribute the lemon evenly throughout the dish.

                            I like to use English cucumber in this dish. It doesn’t need to be peeled because of its thin skin. Any kind of cucumber will do, though.

                            If you won’t eat this Mediterranean rice all at once, you may want to set aside the extra portion before stirring in the cucumbers and olives. That way, you won’t need to heat the cucumber and olives when you heat the leftover rice.
