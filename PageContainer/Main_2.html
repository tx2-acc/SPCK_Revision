                        <p>
                            A quick soup recipe is a great meal any time of year. A light bowl of soup makes a simple summer dinner, and it will also warm you up on a cold winter evening. Since I’m a bit impatient in the kitchen, I love to use my Instant Pot for soup recipes.
                            I love the sweet, savory flavor of this delicious Instant Pot carrot soup. It’s so simple to make, and it’s full of veggie goodness.
                            The leftovers are perfect for lunch on a busy day. Serve this soup with a bit of crusty bread and a side salad for a light, satisfying meal.

                            This Instant Pot ginger carrot soup couldn’t be easier to make. Just throw everything in the pressure cooker, set it for 10 minutes, and let the magic pot do the work. After everything is cooked, you can puree the soup with an immersion blender, or blend it with a traditional blender.
                            Once the soup is pureed, taste it and adjust the seasonings to your liking. I add about a teaspoon of salt and a bit of pepper. If your carrots aren’t very sweet, you may want to add a little pure maple syrup to balance out the flavors. Garnish the soup with any fresh herbs or spices you have on hand, such as fresh thyme or curry powder. Add a bit of full-fat coconut milk if you want a creamier dairy-free soup.
                            If you don’t have a pressure cooker, you can make this soup on the stove top instead. Place all the ingredients in a large pot, and bring the mixture just to a boil over medium high heat. Then lower the temperature to a simmer and cook, covered, until the carrots are soft. Puree the mixture and serve warm.
                            Try my Instant Pot butternut squash soup and Instant Pot detox vegetable soup for other easy vegan pressure cooker meals.
