                        <span>About Instant Pot Steamed Broccoli & Tips</span> 
                        <p>Broccoli is a go-to side dish in my house. It’s one of my favorite veggies. While my kids don’t always appreciate it on their plates, they’re usually willing to eat it because they know it’s good for them.
                            It can be hard to time steamed broccoli just right when you cook it on the stove. If you leave it on for a minute or two longer than necessary, it becomes dark and mushy.
                            That’s why I like to make pressure cooker broccoli. When I steam broccoli in the Instant Pot, there’s no guesswork about timing. It comes out just how I want it every time.
                            This zero minute cook time method works perfectly for Instant Pot cauliflower and Instant Pot asparagus, too. It works with other vegetables like green beans as well.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            I like to use a half cup of water to steam a pound of broccoli. It comes out tender, but not mushy.
                            If you’d like the broccoli to be softened even more so you can mash it, use one cup of water instead. The larger amount of water will cause the pot to take longer to come to pressure. This results in the broccoli being steamed for a bit longer.
                            You can use a regular steamer basket like you’d use in a pot on the stove.
                            When I’m in a hurry, I serve this pressure cooker broccoli sprinkled with salt and pepper. If I have a little extra time, I return the steamed broccoli to the empty Instant Pot and set it to Saute. I top it with a little sesame oil and tamari sauce, and saute it for a minute. You could top it with parmesan cheese as well if you’re not avoiding dairy, or try a bit of nutritional yeast on top.
