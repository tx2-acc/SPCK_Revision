                        <span>About Oat Flour Cookies</span> 
                        <p>
                            These oat flour cookies are soft in the middle and crispy on the edges, and they’re full of chocolatey goodness. They taste just like regular chocolate chip cookies, and they’re ready to eat in less than 30 minutes.
                        </p>

                            Chocolate chip cookies are a favorite treat in my house. I used to make them with a gluten-free flour mix due to a gluten sensitivity, but I’m now a convert to oat flour cookies. Oat flour is a cheaper, healthier whole grain option, and it works really well in cookies. These have the best chocolate flavor, and the texture is both soft and crispy.
                            The first time I tested out this recipe, it was a bit of a disaster. The batter was too wet, and the cookies spread out flat and wide. They broke apart into pieces when I removed them from the cookie sheet. I salvaged the pieces, and when my family tried them, they actually raved about how delicious they were and asked me to make them again. Even a faulty batch of cookies is a good thing.
                            After several test batches, I’ve got this recipe just right. I hope you enjoy this whole grain dessert as much as we do.
