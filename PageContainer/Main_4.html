                        <p>
                            The Instant Pot is one of my favorite tools for a dependable dinner. The recipes aren’t always “instant,” but results are consistent when meals are cooked in a pressure cooker. Dishes like Instant Pot potato salad and Instant Pot beef stew come out perfectly every time.
                            These Instant Pot country style pork ribs are the perfect easy dinner. They come out fall-apart tender every time. Topped with your favorite bbq sauce, these Instant Pot country style ribs are pure comfort food.

                            You can use boneless or bone-in country style pork ribs for this recipe. I’ve made it using both types, and it works either way.
                            The liquid is a combination of water and apple cider vinegar in addition to the barbecue sauce. For added flavor, you can substitute beef stock or chicken broth for the water if desired. 
                            For ribs that are 2 to 2 1/2 inches thick, I pressure cook them for 35 minutes at high pressure. If your ribs are thinner, you can lower the cook time to 30 minutes. 
                            Some people like to broil the ribs to caramelize the barbecue sauce coating after the Instant Pot cook time. I personally don’t think it’s necessary, but you’re welcome to add that step if you’re looking for an oven-baked finish.
                            For a spicy version of country ribs, add a little cayenne pepper or Cajun seasoning to the salt and pepper spice rub. I use my homemade barbecue sauce, but you could use a spicier store-bought bbq sauce as well.
