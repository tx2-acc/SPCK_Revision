                        <span>About Vegetarian Cassoulet & Tips</span> 
                        <p>Cassoulet is a French dish that was traditionally made with whatever meat and beans were available. Originally a peasant meal, cassoulet has taken many forms over the years in the different villages of southern France. </p>
                        <p>
                            While many versions of cassoulet include meat, this vegetarian cassoulet is delicious and hearty on its own. Itâ€™s a healthy one-pot meal full of beans and produce. The garlic bread crumbs are simple to make, and they give this vegan cassoulet a nice little crunch.</p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from the fresh produce, all the ingredients in this vegetarian cassoulet are pantry staples that I typically have on hand. This is a convenient meal to make any time of year, and it makes a great leftover lunch.</p>
                        <p>
                            I use canned cannellini beans in this recipe. You could alternately cook dried beans, which are a bit more affordable than the canned version. 

                            The bay leaf and sprigs of fresh thyme give this recipe a nice flavor as they simmer in the vegetarian cassoulet. I recommend using fresh thyme rather than dried thyme in this recipe. Remove the bay leaf and the stems of thyme before serving.
                            
                            The breadcrumb topping gives this meal a nice extra crunch and flavor. You can cook the breadcrumbs in the oven while the vegetarian cassoulet is simmering. Store the leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature.
